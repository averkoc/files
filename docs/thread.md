## Threads
Threads are a way to add parallel operations within an application process. They share the same virtual memory but are scheduled independently by the OS scheduler. For example, the load testing program siege uses multiple threads to send requests to the server under test. Each thread can be thought of as a simulated user sending requests to the server.
