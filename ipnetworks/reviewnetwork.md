## Overview description

Company A, Company B, and Company C received their IP network addresses when they subscribed to internet connection service from the ISP.  

The home or small office networks marked with yellow are using internally private IP-network addresses and share one public IP-address via NAT. The left hand customer has static public IP-address and the right hand customer a dynamic public IP-address.

The ISP offers a recursive DNS resolver that customers can configure in their computer's IP settings if they choose.  
The picture also shows the authoratative  name server for domains compa.fi and compb.fi.
