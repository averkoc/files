## Overview description

Company A, Company B, and Company C received their IP network addresses when they subscribed to internet connection service from the ISP.  

The home or small office networks marked with yellow are using internally private IP-network addresses and share one public IP-address via NAT. The left hand customer has static public IP-address and the right hand customer a dynamic public IP-address.

The ISP offers a recursive DNS resolver that customers can configure in their computer's IP settings if they choose.  
The picture also shows the authoratative  name server for domains compa.fi and compb.fi.  


## Configuration - CompanyA
Company A's network is based on wired Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) and wireless WiFi (IEEE 802.11) LAN technologies. The Ethernet LAN consists of switch(es), cabling, and end devices that support the Ethernet standard. The wireless LAN includes Access Point that contain bridging functionality, making the WiFi and Ethernet LANs appear as a single logical network for connected devices.

We configure the Company A network to be an IP network by assigning IP settings to all end devices connected to the LAN. These IP settings consist of an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway IP address, and <abr title="This is actually a recursive resolving server">DNS server</abbr> IP address(es). The default gateway is the IP address of the ISP router's interface that connects to Company A's LAN. The default gateway handles routing IP packets into and out of Company A's IP network.
