## Network Technologies underlying IP Networks
- Local Area Networks
  - Ethernet 802.3 (Wired)
  - WiFi (802.11) Wireless
- Operator (ISP) Networks based on different technologies


## IP Settings
- **Manual settings**
  - IP address
  - Subnet mask
  - Default Gateway
  - DNS Server (recursive DNS server)

- **Dynamic settings**
  - IP settings got from DHCP-server
  - _DHCP-server configuration example_

## Domain Name System
- Administrative aspects
- Technical Infrastructure

## Network Address Translation (NAT)
- public IP address sharing for computers in private IP-network

## Transport Layer
- TCP
  - application processes identification by port numbers
  - automatic error recovery: checksums, sequence numbers, acknowledgements
  - flow control: window sizes, acknowledgements
  - session concept: both parties need to accept the session initiation before data transfer can start
- UDP
  - application processes identification by port numbers
  - no session concept
 
## Application layer
- In simplified terms, application protocols define the command and answer messages structures that client and server application developers use to implement applications functionalities
