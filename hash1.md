### File integrity verification
Here are some reasons why you should check the integrity of downloaded files
1. to verify that a file has not corrupted during download
2. verify that you have uncompromized file (one that is not altered by some third party)

To verify that your downloaded ova-files are not corrupted during download, you should compare their checksums (hash-values)
against correct one. You can do this by issuing command: `certutil -hashfile *.ova sha256` in in your cmd prompt in the directory where you downloaded the ova-files.   

Copy your checksum to the input field below and select a correct reference value to check to whether your checksum  
matches the correct one.
